        <p>After further discussion with Adam, we do have the capabilities to bind multiple projects to one repo in git.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="ListParagraph">Click yes, then do a commit- all files will be in a pending add state.</p>

        <p class="ListParagraph">&#160;</p>
        <p class="ListParagraph">Another solution would be to create a new folder through Windows, then, then use gitbash to initialize it.</p>
        <p class="ListParagraph">Create your new projects in this folder and you will have your bindings</p>
